Users can “Launch the Goose” and discover “Interesting Facts about Banderoguses,” including GPS and echolocation navigation, thermal vision, and “wing rockets” capable of carrying guided missiles. The app also includes a playful sign-up to join the “Banderogusak Squad,” where users can enter their name and email to humorously enlist their goose.
